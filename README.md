 ### **User Requirements and Expectations**

#### **Requirements**
- To navigate the website using the navbar easily and quickly.
- To be provided with useful information on covid-19 and other information of interest.
- Content displayed in an easy to read and clear manner.
- Information displayed in a concise manner that is easy to digest.
- Easy access to information without having to go to multiple websites and read vast amounts of information

#### **Expectations**
- Content is quick to locate and easy to read.
- Navigation is simple to use and intuitive even to those who are not overly tech literate.
- All external links open in a separate tab so they can easily get back to the original site.
- All external links open to the relevant part of the site rather than the home page

### **Design**
#### **Colour Scheme**
When designing this site, I researched how best to design for an older demographic. I wanted to ensure that the website was intuitive to use easy to navigate, had clear text, with good contrast and large clickable areas for ease of use for individuals with reduced dexterity, while still being visually appealing.
This is most evident in the responsive navbar which maintains a full width clickable area for all screen sizes. With the expanded menu present in large and medium screen sizes and a collapsible button with “menu” text as opposed to a burger icon to ensure the purpose of it is clear even to those that are not overly computer literate.
I loosely based my website design off the CV project from the course material and adapted it to better suit my target demographic and suit the aesthetic I was trying to achieve.

 #### **Colour Scheme**
The colors I used were inspired by the header image which I found in the Shutterstock library
I used a colour picker tool to get the hex values for the colours from the image. 
- For the Website title, footer and menu button, in mobile view I used #547864
- For the home page titles and nav button I used #7B9AB9
- For the medical Info nav button, page titles and icons I used #F4ABC7
- For the social page nav button, and all associated page’s titles and icons I used #8AB69E
- For useful contacts and resources, nav button, titles and icons I used #F25637

#### **Typography**
- The Exo font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Exo is a clean font as it is both attractive and appropriate. The font is easy to read and the colors used in the typography ensure a high contrast between the font and the background color which is an important feature when developing a site for more senior web users. 
#### **Imagery**
-  Imagery is important. The large, background header image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic and relevant aesthetic.

#### **Icons**
- I used Icons form Font Awesome add a visual representation of text. I used sparingly and only where appropriate and where I felt they would add value. I struggled to find some appropriate font awesome icons that were appropriate and work in with the version of font awesome that I was using. This is most noticeable on the medical info page as I couldn’t find an icon to represent a sore throat and ended up having to reuse the tissue box.

### **Wireframes**

-   Mobile Wireframe - ![Mobile Wireframe](assets/images/mobile-wireframe.jpg)

-   Tablet Wireframe - ![Tablet Wireframe](assets/images/tablet-wireframe.jpg)

-   Desktop Wireframe - ![Desktop WIreframe](assets/images/desktop-wireframe.jpg)
- I initially felt I would divide the homepage into multiple different clickable areas that would link to the various pages of the website. However, having completed my wireframing I felt not only did this complicate the homepage, making it more difficult to navigate but it just replicated the navbar and it felt as if I was trying to fill space. Ideally, I did not want to use a collapsible navbar however through wireframing I quickly discovered that to maintain a large clickable area for the navbar it took up too much space on mobile device so decided to use a collapsible navbar for this screen size.

### **What didn't make the cut**
There were a few features and layout choice that I had to make in order to make the site more accessible for its users. Initially I wanted to have more elements in the navbar, while it looked ok in the wireframes having made the original navbar with 6 elements (exercise and entertainment as their own sections) I realized that this not only made the navigation of the page more complex but also reduced the clickable area of the nav elements. A large clickable area is a desirable feature for older users due to reduced dexterity. For this reason, I decided to simplify the page and the navbar to four main sections. I had also considered including a carousel on the homepage, however I felt that this may make the site too complex. Also, having read some information on carousels I saw that the click through rate on them were low so felt it would not add to the site
